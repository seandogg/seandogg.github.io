  summary: >
    Six years experience coding and designing websites, web apps, and email campaigns for high volume/high sales retail websites.
    I’ve worked both on development teams, and solo. Including in-house, and remote roles.
    My tools are **Sketch**, **Adobe XD**, **Photoshop**, **Git**, **HTML5**, **Liquid**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. I’ve recently been exploring GraphQL and Shopify Apps.
    Working on teams, I’m typically considered as the one **bridging gap between design and code**, creating pixel-perfect UI, and coding performant user experiences that look great and run well.
