# Hi! I code and design web sites.
Working professionally since 2014, I coded my first website in . I'm currently running a tiny [web design and development shop](https://grizzlypoppy.com) on an island near Seattle.

Working mainly with Shopify and Shopify Plus merchants, my work occasionally extends outside of eCommerce touching other aspects of modern **frontend web development** and **UI/UX design**.

My work is rooted in **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**. 

Mainly contracting with agencies and brands from around the globe, I'm humbled to be considered a **consultant**, **mentor**, **ux engineer**, **teacher**, and **web designer** to amazing artists, popular brands, and budding startups.
 
‚ÄçSeven years into my career, I approach each project with utmost dedication to my clients and my craft.
