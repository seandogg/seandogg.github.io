# Hi üëã I design and code for the web.
I began building websites in 2004 as a hobby. Ten years later, I began working in digital agencies, mainly specializing in HTML and CSS code for WordPress and Shopify.
 
Fast forward six years and I'm now running my own tiny [web design and development shop](https://grizzlypoppy.com) from an island near Seattle.

With over six years of coding and UX design experience, I understand the complexities of turning ideas into designs and designs into websites and apps.  

Working mainly with Shopify and Shopify Plus merchants, my work occasionally touches other aspects of modern **frontend web development** and **UI/UX design**.

My work is rooted in **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**, and my UX designs reflect an understanding of code, the browser and each site's users.   

Contracting with agencies and brands from around the globe, I'm humbled to be considered a **consultant**, **mentor**, **ux engineer**, **teacher**, and **web designer** to amazing artists, popular brands, and budding startups.
 
‚ÄçSeven years into my career, I approach each project with the utmost dedication to my clients and my work.
