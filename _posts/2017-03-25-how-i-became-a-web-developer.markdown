## How Did I Get Here?
I didn't set out to write software for a living. I figured I'd work outdoors, tour with a band playing music, or travel the world surfing & snowboarding (all of which I can say I've done). But life has a strange way of unexpectedly happening.

What began as a hobby in school eventually became my full-time trade, and here we are. On the internet. Together.

### The Early Days
It was 2002. I was a student in the journalism department at CSU Long Beach. Luckily the university had the foresight to see the inevitable demise of the printed newspaper. We were encouraged to study `html` and `css` in addition to the regular curricula of `design`, `copy editing`, `writing` and `investigative journalism`. 

Newspaper sales were crashing as we began to rely more and more on the web for our information. Media companies were struggling to generate new income streams on the web. The transition wasn't smooth. To top it off, the US war on terror was raging and it was possibly the worst moment in history to find a job in the news business.

After graduation, I was offered a design job at a local newspaper. The offer was for `$21,000 USD per year`. I declined and decided to keep my seasonal job (earning $28,000 in 5 months) and take to `drifting` around the world surfing the rest of the year.

### The Earlier Days
Luckily I kept those `html` and `css` chops. I did it for fun. I'd grown up with computers so I knew my way around the machine. I'd create blogs, make sites for myself and just generally dabble in code. Nothing serious. 

In 2005, after returning to the US from living abroad, I set out to create a website for **The Noetic Society**, a non-profit Philosophy group led by Pierre Grimes. Pierre was a freshman-year college philosophy professor that holds a group that ancient Greek Philosophy and philosophical counseling. 

The site launched that year and was my first project released into the wild that wasn't a blog or otherwise part of some CMS. 

### Burn Out #1
 
From that site, others followed. I was soon offered a job to create a website for a print magazine. **This is when I began getting overwhelmed**. It wasn't the code, it was business. I had no business acumen. 

Because I never set out to be a professional web guy, I knew nothing about invoicing, scope of work, running a business, managing expectations and all the dirty stuff that comes with being in business.

`I hit eject`. After that project I stopped taking clients. I was burnt out on website development and opted to return to my seasonal job as an ocean lifeguard.

### Craftsmen Years

I knew the lifeguarding gig wasn't a long-term option. Full-time positions were few and far between, and I was getting `burnt out` on that too. I wrapped up another summer and began working for a flooring contractor.
 
My boss was a master carpenter. Together we installed, repaired and restored hardwood floors. I grew strong hands and a strong back, worked all day and became very handy with all types of power and hand tools. We typically worked on `multi-million dollar homes` in Laguna Beach and surrounding areas.

Life was good. I put in a solid two years of work, made good money and generally enjoyed life. 

And then it bottomed out. Construction slowed, the money began to slow - and the lack of healthcare and benefits was a big cost out-of-pocket. 

### Bridging the Gap(s)

With the stop-and-go income from construction, I decided to go back to web development full force. But this time I took a contractor's approach. 

Working for the master carpenter taught me the value of honest, hard work. `It also taught me how to invoice, estimate a job (by measuring things) and the importance of word-of-mouth over any type of advertising`.

After burying myself in `learning to code` (again), the freelancing snowballed and business picked up -- but this time I had a new approach.
