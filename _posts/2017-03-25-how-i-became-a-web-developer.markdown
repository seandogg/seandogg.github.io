## A Strange Path
I didn't set out to write software for a living. I figured I'd **work outdoors, tour with a band, or travel around living out of a backpack**. But alas, life has a strange, meandering path.

What began as my hobby in college eventually became a full-time trade -- how that all happened I will attempt to describe here. On the internet.

### Way back machine

In 2002 I was a student in the journalism department at CSU Long Beach. Luckily the university had the foresight to see the inevitable demise of the printed newspaper. We were encouraged to study **html** and **css** in addition to the regular curricula of **design**, **copy editing**, **writing** and **investigative journalism**. 

By 2004 newspaper sales were crashing and we began relying on the web for our daily information. Twitter wasn't even invented yet.

### Travel Days

I was reluctant to find full-time work in the journalism world, and instead, I set about living my 20s doing the dirtbag surf/travel thing, spending half my year **lifeguarding in Huntington Beach** and the other half **traveling to Indonesia, Mexico, Central America, Canada or some other far away land**.

I continued dabbling in **html** and **css** while traveling. I did it for fun really. I'd grown up with computers so I knew my way around the machine. I'd make blogs with my travel photos & writing, publish content and stories in **surf magazines** and write trip reports on forums. I generally messed around on **Blogger**. Nothing serious.

### Making stuff for other people

Things began getting a bit more professional in 2005. That was when I created my first (real) website for a local non-profit. I built it with Adobe DreamWeaver. The site launched without any major issues and it was my first project that wasn't a blogger site or a custom myspace profile. It was straight-up code! No CMS.
 
After creating that site, I was soon offered a few other jobs to create a websites for other people via word-of-mouth. When I began saying **yes** all the time is things went south. **After a year or so, I was overwhelmed**. It wasn't the code, it was the business of coding. 

**I had zero business skills.**

### The First Burn Out

In the beginning, I hadn't set out to be a professional web guy. Teaching myself, I realized the hard way that I knew nothing about invoicing, scope of work, running a business, managing expectations and all the **business stuff** that comes with self-employment.

After one particularly tough client I had had enough. **I hit eject.** After that project I stopped taking clients altogether. I folded the laptop and focused elsewhere. I was burnt out on **the business of website development**. I returned to my seasonal job as an ocean lifeguard and lives were saved.

This was the view from my office:

### Leaving the beach

The lifeguarding gig wasn't a long-term option me. Permanent lifeguard jobs are rare, and I was getting burnt out dealing with the hordes of people in HB. I wrapped up another safe summer and tried my luck apprenticing with a master hardwood flooring contractor.

#### Lessons from woodworking
 
I worked with said carpenter for 16 months. Together we installed, repaired and restored hardwood floors. We worked in multi-million dollar houses. I grew strong hands and a strong back and worked all day with power tools. It was good.

In construction world I made a decent life for myself and, more importantly, learned skills that I still use all the time. 

But things eventually slowed down. The US economy took a pause and without back-to-back jobs I was left out to dry. 

### The Do-Over

When the woodworking slowed, I decided to try another go with web development. But this time I took a contractor's approach to the business. Looking back, I now had a mature approach to **the business of web design**. 

You see, not only did I learn woodwork from that old master craftsman, I learned the importance of bidding, estimating, drawing a fair scope of work, and delivering something that truly pleased the end user. It was basically what I was missing the first time around.

After burying myself in code again, the freelance gigs and job offers snowballed -- and I've taken a craftsman's approach to the craft ever since.
