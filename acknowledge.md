#P.S Thanks for all the fish!

This is my first theme so as you can imagine I had to fork an existing theme. I looked around for suitable themes on GitHub and finally settled on Cole Townsend's [Balzac for Jekyll](http://link). I choose the theme because it was great for a lot of text and I wanted to write a lot of text and make it beautiful. I had absolutely no knowledge of the liquid templating language or sass. So I had to learn on the fly. As a result if you look at the code, prepare for the worst.
