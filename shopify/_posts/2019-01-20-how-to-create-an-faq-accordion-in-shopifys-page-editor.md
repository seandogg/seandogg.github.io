## About this snippet
Building an FAQ accordion for Shopify's internal rich text editor almost always comes up during client projects, so I figured I would share some code that other merchants can use.

This pure CSS accordion doesn't require `jquery` or `javascript` to work.

Copy and paste the snippet below into the <> code section of Shopify's page editor.

**Note:** This code will inherit your theme's properties and won't necessarily look like the one in the video.
