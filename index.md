## I run a web shop called [Grizzly & Poppy](https://grizzlypoppy.com)
I'm working on Shopify solutions for a bunch of awesome clients including: **[The Elder Statesman](https://elder-statesman.com/)**, **[Beyonce](https://shop.beyonce.com/)**, **[Modern Times Beer](http://www.moderntimesbeer.com/)**, **[The Black Eyed Peas](https://store.blackeyedpeas.com/)**, **[Cleobella](https://shop.cleobella.com/)**, **[CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/)**, **[Deseda](https://www.shopdeseda.com/)**, **[Sebastian Manascalco](https://shop.sebastianlive.com/)**, and more!

I'm usually **writing frontend code** for agencies that on-shore their web development work to me, but I also work directly with merchants solving a variety of fun problems on Shopify.

## My story
The son of a [C programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language), I had access to computers from a very young age (this was during the 80s & 90s - [dial up modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem), [MS-Dos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), AOL, and all that).

I built my first website back in 2004 for a non-profit. After that, I had a little hustle customizing people's myspace profiles! Although a bit embarrasing, this gig actually taught me so much about html and css!

Later, in 2012, I created a food product which was sold at Whole Foods and smaller health-food grocery stores. I built an ecommerce store for it -- first with WordPress, and later with Shopify. This was when I really fell in love with [Shopify](https://shopify.com) -- as a merchant.

In 2013, I sold my share of that company, and started a career as a "real-life" web developer at a digital agency in California.

Working for that agency, I developed a better understanding of **WordPress** and **Shopify**, and practiced writing semantic **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** in a more professional environment.

After working at a couple agencies in California as a web developer for a few years, I took a break from the agency world, and in 2016 accepted a position at a biotech company in a formal/corporate software engineering role.

---

Working on a team of 60 engineers helped me to learn some deeper aspects programming such as **command line**, **git**, **regex**, **working with data & large databases**, developing traditional **design systems**, and translating complex business logic into wireframes.

After that company went through a merger and big round of layoffs, I returned to the digital agency world, and in 2017 we were relocating to San Francisco where I took a position working for a leading Shopify Plus agency solving all kinds of interesting Shopify puzzles.

---

In 2018 my job was cut from the agency, and I decided founding my own [tiny agency](https://grizzlypoppy.com) would be best. Having our own business allowed our little family the freedom to move to a rural island in the Pacific Northwest, where we're happily raising our kids, and practicing regenerative farming for ourselves and our local community food bank.
