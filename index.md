## I design and code online retail experiences.
I work on Shopify solutions for a bunch of awesome clients including: **[Beyonce](https://shop.beyonce.com/)**, **[Modern Times Beer](http://www.moderntimesbeer.com/)**, **[The Black Eyed Peas](https://store.blackeyedpeas.com/)**, **[Cleobella](https://shop.cleobella.com/)**, **[CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/)**, **[Deseda](https://www.shopdeseda.com/)**, **[Sebastian Manascalco](https://shop.sebastianlive.com/)**, and more!

The bulk of my day-to-day is spent **writing frontend code** for busy digital agencies (HTML, SCSS & JavaScript), but I also work directly with merchants, including retailers referred from [**Shopify Plus**](https://www.shopify.com/plus?ref=orfila-design).

## The Backstory
I (kinda) built my first website in 2004. 

In 2013 I was hired for my first "official" junior web developer job at a small agency near the beach in my native California. 

I developed a good understanding of **WordPress** and **Shopify** during this time, and furthered my understanding of semantic **HTML** and **CSS** in a more formal, professional setting. This is when I also gained a good grasp of SEO. 

After working at a few other agencies in California, I took a break from the agency world, and in 2016 began working for a corporation as **one of the only frontend web developers on a team of 60 engineers**. 

Working on that team forced me to learn deeper aspects programming such as **command line tools**, **git**, **regex**, **working with data**, developing **design systems**, and translating business logic into wireframes! 

After that company went through a merger, I returned to agency life, and we up-and-moved the whole fam to the Bay Area, where I took a position working for the **largest Shopify Plus agency in San Francisco**. 

In 2018, I decided to follow my dream and branch out on my own -- starting my own [tiny agency](https://grizzlypoppy.com). It's just me and my wife! This allowed us the flexability to move to a rustic, rural island in the Pacific Northwest, where we're happily raising our children. 

## The extras
I grew up surfing and snowboarding. I love growing groceries and soil science. I worked a couple years as a journeyman carpenter, and love building stuff with wood. 
 
 I work on, and collect, vintage cars. I'm a total weather geek, particularly when it comes to forecasting surf & snow. 
 
 The majority of my time, however, is dedicated to my children and developing highly valuable solutions for my clients' business üòâ.

I have a little office space in the charming village of Langley, WA. From my window, I can see Glacier Peak, Mt. Baker, the Cascades, and the occasional orca passing on Puget Sound.
