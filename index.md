## I design and code online retail experiences.
I work on Shopify solutions for a bunch of awesome clients including: **[The Elder Statesman](https://elder-statesman.com/)**, **[Beyonce](https://shop.beyonce.com/)**, **[Modern Times Beer](http://www.moderntimesbeer.com/)**, **[The Black Eyed Peas](https://store.blackeyedpeas.com/)**, **[Cleobella](https://shop.cleobella.com/)**, **[CrossFit](https://www.crossfit.com/)**, **[Deseda](https://www.shopdeseda.com/)**, **[Sebastian Manascalco](https://shop.sebastianlive.com/)**, and more!

I'm usually **writing frontend code** for agencies that on-shore their web development work to me, but I also work directly with merchants solving a variety of fun problems on Shopify.

## My story
The son of a [C programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_programming_language), I had access to computers from a very young age (this was during the 80s & 90s - [dial up modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem), [MS-Dos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), AOL, and all that).

I built my first website back in 2004 for a non-profit. After that, I had a little hustle customizing people's myspace profiles! Although a bit embarrasing, this gig actually taught me so much about html and css!

Later, I designed a health food product and sold it online -- first with WordPress, and later with Shopify in 2012. This was when I really fell in love with [Shopify](https://shopify.com) as a "platform".

---

In 2013, I sold my share of that company, and "officially" started a career as a web developer at a digital agency in California.

Working for that agency, I developed a better understanding of **WordPress** and **Shopify**, and practiced writing semantic **HTML** and **CSS** in a more professional environment.

After working at a couple agencies in California as a web developer for a few years, I took a break from the agency world, and in 2016 accepted a position at medium/large-size biotech company in a formal software engineering role.

---

Working on a team of 60 engineers helped me to learn some deeper aspects programming such as **command line**, **git**, **regex**, **working with data & large databases**, developing traditional **design systems**, and translating complex business logic into wireframes.

After that company went through a merger and big round of layoffs (not my fault), I returned to agency life, and in 2017 was relocating to San Francisco where I took a position working for a leading Shopify Plus agency.

---

In late 2018, I decided following my dream of entrepreneurship would need to happen.

I left the agency position and started my own [tiny agency](https://grizzlypoppy.com). Being my own business allowed me and my little family the freedom to move to a semi-rural island in the Pacific Northwest, where we're happily raising our kids near the local Waldorf school, set amongst the forests, farms, and beaches of Puget Sound.

My little office (upstairs the restaurant)
{:.figure .tl}

I have a charming office space in the sea-side hamlet of Langley, WA - just a ferry and traffic jam away from busy Seattle. From my window, I can see Glacier Peak, Mt. Baker, the Cascades, and the occasional whale.

**Note**: I've recently moved my office into our home due to coronavirus! Hope to be working in my office again someday soon.
